Introduction:
Junwei Huang is a visiting postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Prof. Robert Pilawa-Podgurski. He is also a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute of Microelectronics, University of Macau, where he is advised by Prof. Rui P. Martins and collaborates with Prof. Yan Lu (Tsinghua University). He received his B.Eng. degree in Microelectronics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, in 2018, and his Ph.D. degree from the State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI (AMSV), University of Macau, in 2024. His research interests include power-management ICs, particularly high-voltage-conversion-ratio DC–DC converters and highly integrated on-chip and in-package voltage regulators with high current density, high efficiency, and fast transient response for next-generation computing systems.
